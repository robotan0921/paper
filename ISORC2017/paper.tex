\begin{abstract}

Embedded systems are applied to Internet of Things (IoT), and the high productivity of embedded network software is required.
TINET is a TCP/IP protocol stack for embedded systems.
Although TINET is a compact TCP/IP protocol stack, it consists of many complex source codes.
Therefore, it is difficult to maintain, extend, and analysis the software.

To improve the scalability and configurability, this paper has proposed a component-based TCP/IP protocol stack for embedded systems: TINET componentized with TOPPERS embedded component system (TECS).
The component-based TINET provides software developers high productivity such as change of network buffer size and adding/removing TCP (or UDP) function.
We evaluate the component-based TINET compared with the original TINET.
We confirm that the overheads of execution time and memory consumption are low, and that the configurability is improved.

In this paper, we also demonstrates a use case of the dynamic component connection method of TECS with a network application.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:Introduction}

Internet of Things (IoT) is an essential keyword for the next era.
Such as wearable devices, smart devices, and smart homes, various things are connected to the Internet, enriching our lives.
Embedded systems are the elements constituting IoT, e.g., sensing data and controlling actuators.
It is not practical to implement the same communication function as a general computer because embedded systems have several restrictions such as low memory capacity.

TINET (Tomakomai InterNETworking) is a compact TCP/IP protocol stack for embedded systems \cite{url:TINET}.
TINET supports the ability such as minimum copy frequency and elimination of dynamic memory control.
TINET needs only small memory for its TCP/IP protocol stack; therefore it is suitable for embedded systems.
However, there are several issues that TINET consists of many complex source codes.
In other words, TINET is composed of many files and defines many macros.
This may take a lot of time for software developers to maintain, extend, and analysis the software.
Embedded network software is required for the high productivity and quality.

Component-based development is an approach to improve software productivity.
Component-based development is a design technique that can be applied to reusable software development \cite{par:Crnkovic}\cite{par:CBD}, such as TECS \cite{par:TECS}, AUTOSAR \cite{url:AUTOSAR}, and SaveCCM \cite{par:SAVEapproach}.
Component-based systems are flexible to software extension and specification changes.
In addition, individual component diagrams enable the visualization of an entire system.

In this paper, component-based TCP/IP protocol stack, i.e., componentized TINET, is proposed to improve the configurability and scalability of software.
TECS (TOPPERS Embedded Component System) \cite{par:TECS} is utilized to componentize TINET, because TECS is a component system suitable for embedded systems.
TECS supports static configuration, which statically defines component behaviors and interconnections, thus TECS can optimize the overhead of componentization.
This paper evaluates the overheads of execution time and memory consumption and amount of code line change for adding/removing the functionalities, which demonstrates TINET+TECS can improve the configurability with small overheads.

{\bf Contributions:} This paper provides the following contributions.

\begin{enumerate}

    \item {\bf Improve configurability}\mbox{}\\
        TINET+TECS is a component-based system, therefore the software is flexible to change the configuration such as resizing network buffer, adding/removing TCP (or UDP) functions, and support both IPv4 and IPv6.
        In addition, a component diagram provides visualization of TINET, a complicated system.

    \item {\bf Dynamic connection method}\mbox{}\\
        

    \item {\bf Support legacy codes}\mbox{}\\
        TECS supports the adapter to call TECS functions from existing C codes, thus TINET+TECS can be applied to an existing application.
    % \item {\bf Software visualization}

\end{enumerate}

{\bf Organization}: The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.
Section \ref{sec:System Model} introduces the system model and basic technologies, i.e., TINET and TECS.
Section \ref{sec:Design and Implementation} describes the design and implementation of the proposed framework.
Section \ref{sec:Evaluation and Demonstration} evaluates the proposed framework.
Related work is discussed in Section \ref{sec:Related Work}.
Conclusions and suggestions for future work are presented in Section \ref{sec:Conclusion}.


\section{System Model}
\label{sec:System Model}

This section describes system model, including the basic technologies such as TINET and TECS.
System model of the proposed system is shown as Fig. \ref{fig:System Model}.

\begin{figure}[t]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=6.5cm,clip]{figure/SystemModel.pdf}
    \caption{System model}

\end{figure}

\subsection{TINET}

TINET is a compact TCP/IP protocol stack for embedded systems based on the ITRON TCP/IP API Specification \cite{url:ITRON_TCP/IP_API_Spec}, developed by TOPPERS (Toyohashi OPen Platform for Embedded Real-time Systems) Project \cite{url:TOPPERS}.
TINET has been released as open source.

To satisfy restrictions for embedded systems such as memory capacity, size, and power consumption, TINET supports following functions:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Minimum copy frequency
    \item Elimination of dynamic memory control
    \item Asynchronous interface
    \item Error detailed per API
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Overview}

TINET runs as middleware on TOPPERS/ASP3 \cite{url:ASP3}, which is a realtime kernel based on $\mu$ITRON \cite{par:microITRON}.
TINET also supports other RTOSs such as TOPPERS/ASP and TOPPERS/JSP because TINET is compatible with TOPPERS RTOS.
Fig. \ref{fig:TINET_Hier} shows the hierarchy diagram of TINET and TOPPERS/ASP3.
% TINET supports ITRON TCP/IP API such as {\it tcp\_snd\_buf}, {\it tcp\_rcv\_buf}, {\it udp\_snd\_buf}, and {\it udp\_rcv\_buf}.
Users transmit and receive the data using a Communication End Point (CEP) which is an interface like a socket.
In transmission process, headers are attached to the data body passed to the CEP at each protocol layer, and the data is transmitted from the network device.
In reception process, headers of the data body received in the network device are analyzed at each protocol layer, and the data is passed to the CEP.

In TINET, the number of the data copy between each protocol layers is minimized.
A TCP/IP protocol stack for general computers has large overheads of execution time and memory consumption because the data is copied at each protocol layers.
To solve the problem, TINET does pass the pointer of the data buffer between each protocol layers, not perform data copy.

\end{figure}


\subsection{TECS}
\label{sec:TECS}

TECS is a component system suitable for embedded systems.
TECS can increase productivity and reduce development costs owing to improved reusability of software components.
TECS also provides component diagrams, which help developers visualize the overall structure of a system.

In TECS, component deployment and composition are performed statically.
Consequently, connecting components does not incur significant overhead and memory requirements can be reduced.
TECS can be implemented in C, and demonstrates various feature such as source level portability and fine-grained components.

\begin{figure}[t]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=6.5cm,clip]{figure/component_diagram.eps}
    \caption{Component Diagram}
    \label{fig:component}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Component Model}

Fig.\ref{fig:component} shows a component diagram.
A {\it cell}, which is an instance of a component in TECS, consists of {\it entry} ports, {\it call} ports, attributes and internal variables.
An {\it entry} port is an interface that provides functions to other {\it cell}s, and a {\it call} port is an interface that enables the use of other {\it cell}'s functions.
A {\it cell} has one or more {\it entry} ports and {\it call} ports.
{\it Cell} functions are implemented in C.

The type of {\it entry}/{\it call} port is defined by a {\it signature}, which is a set of functions.
A {\it signature} is the interface definition of a {\it cell}.
The {\it cell}'s  {\it call} port can be connected to the {\it entry} port of another {\it cell} by the same {\it signature}.
Note that {\it celltype} defines one or more {\it call}/{\it entry} ports, attributes, and internal variables of a {\it cell}.


\subsubsection{Component Description}

In TECS, components are described with component description language (CDL).
CDL can be divided into three categories: {\it signature}, {\it celltype}, and build description.
These components are described as follows.

\begin{description}
    \item[{\bf Signature Description}]\mbox{}\\
        The {\it signature} defines a {\it cell} interface.
        The {\it signature} name follows the keyword {\it signature} and takes the prefix ``s'', e.g., sMotor (Fig.\ref{signature}).
        In TECS, to clarify the function of an interface, specifiers such as [in] and [out] are used, which represent input and output respectively.
\begin{figure}[t]
\centering
\begin{lstlisting}
signature sMotor {
    int32_t getCounts( void );
    ER resetCounts( void );
    ER setPower( [in]int power );
    ER stop( [in] bool_t brake );
    ER rotate( [in] int degrees,
               [in] uint32_t speed_abs,
                [in] bool_t blocking );
    void initializePort( [in]int32_t type );
};
\end{lstlisting}
\caption{Signature Description}
\label{signature}
\end{figure}
    \item[{\bf Celltype Description}]\mbox{}\\
        The {\it celltype} defines {\it entry} ports, {\it call} ports, attributes, and variables.
        A {\it celltype} name with the prefix ``t'' follows the keyword {\it celltype}, e.g., tCaller (Fig.\ref{celltype}).
        To define {\it entry} ports, a {\it signature}, e.g., sMotor, and an {\it entry} port name, e.g., eMotor, follow the keyword {\it entry}.
        {\it Call} ports are defined similarly.
        Attributes and variables follow the keywords {\it attr} and {\it var}, respectively.
\begin{figure}[t]
\centering
\begin{lstlisting}
celltype tCaller {
    call sMotor cMotor;
};
celltype tMotor {
    entry sMotor eMotor;
    attr {
        int32_t port;
    };
    var {
        int32_t currentSpeed = 0;
    };
};
\end{lstlisting}
\caption{Celltype Description}
\label{celltype}
\end{figure}
    \item[{\bf Build Description}]\mbox{}\\
        The build description is used to instantiate and connect {\it cell}s.
        Fig.\ref{build} shows an example of a build description.
        A {\it celltype} name and {\it cell} name, e.g., tMotor and Motor, respectively, follow the keyword {\it cell}.
        A {\it call} port, {\it cell}'s name, and an {\it entry} port are described in that order to compose {\it cell}s,
        In Fig. \ref{build}, {\it entry} port eMotor in {\it cell} Motor is connected to {\it call} port cMotor in {\it cell} Caller.
        {\it C\_EXP} calls macros defined in C files.

\begin{figure}[t]
\centering
\begin{lstlisting}
cell tMotor Motor {
    port = C_EXP("PORT_A");
};
cell tCaller Caller {
    cMotor = Motor.eMotor;
};
\end{lstlisting}
\caption{Build Description}
\label{build}
\end{figure}

\end{description}

\section{Design and Implementation}
\label{sec:Design and Implementation}

TINET+TECS, the proposed componentized TCP/IP protocol stack, consists of some TECS components.
This section describes the components with component diagrams.
In addition, TECS functionalities applied to the proposed system such as {\it send}/{\it receive} specifier and adapter are explained.

\subsection{Components of protocol stack}

\begin{figure}[t]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=6.5cm,clip]{figure/ComponentProtocolStack.pdf}
    \caption{Component diagram of protocol stack}
    \label{fig:ComponentProtocolStack}
\end{figure}

\subsection{send/receive specifier}

TECS supports {\it send}/{\it receive} specifiers, which are interface specifiers \cite{par:RPC}.
TINET+TECS uses {\it send} and {\it receive} specifiers instead of {\it in} and {\it out} to reduce the number of copies.

{\it in} is a specifier for input arguments.
A callee side uses the memory of arguments with {\it in} during executing the callee function.
When the processing returns to the caller side, the caller can reuse and deallocate the memory.

{\it send} is also a specifier for transferring data to a callee from a caller such as {\it in}.
The difference between {\it in} and {\it send} is whether to deallocate the data memory in a caller or callee, shown as Fig. \ref{fig:SendReceive}.
In case of {\it in} specifier, both allocating and deallocating the data memory are performed in the caller.
On the other hand, in case of {\it send}, the caller allocates the data memory and the callee deallocates it.

{\it out} is a specifier for output arguments.
A callee writes data in the memory allocated by a caller, and the caller receives the data.

{\it receive} is also a specifier for a caller receiving data from a callee such as {\it out}.
The difference between {\it out} and {\it receive} is whether to allocate the data memory in a caller or callee, shown as Fig. \ref{fig:SendReceive}.
While, in case of {\it out}, a callee writes data in the memory allocated by a caller, in case of {\it receive}, the callee allocates the data memory.
Deallocating the memory is performed in the caller in both cases.

    \caption{Differences between in/out and send/receive}

\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[t]

\begin{lstlisting}
signature sNicDriver {
  void start([send(sNetworkAlloc),size_is(size)]int8_t *outputp,
             [in]int32_t size,
             [in]uint8_t align);
  void read([receive(sNetworkAlloc),size_is(*size)]int8_t **inputp,
            [out]int32_t *size,
            [in]uint8_t align);
    /* Omit: other functions */
};
\end{lstlisting}
\caption{An example of send and receive}
\label{src:SendReceive}
\end{figure}


\subsection{TECS Adapter}

TECS supports {\it Adapter} functionality which enables to call a function in TECS from existing C codes.
An adapter connects a TECS component, and links a C function to a TECS function shown as Fig. \ref{fig:TECS_Adapter}.
Software developers can utilize an existing application for TECS owing to the adapter.

\section{Related Work}
\label{sec:Related Work}

Open-source TCP/IP protocol stacks for embedded systems have been developed such uIP \cite{par:uIP}.

{\bf uIP:}
uIP (microIP) is a very small TCP/IP stack intended for tiny 8-bit and 16-bit microcontrollers.
uIP only requires about five kilobytes of code size and several hundred bytes of RAM.
uIP has been ported to various systems and has found its way into many commercial products.
After ver. 1.0 is released, later versions of uIP, including uIPv6, are integrated with Contiki OS \cite{par:Contiki},\cite{url:Contiki}, an operating system to connect tiny microcontroller to the Internet.

{\bf lwIP:}
lwIP (lightweightIP) is a small TCP/IP implementation for embedded systems.
The focus of lwIP is to reduce memory resource while still having a full scale TCP.
lwIP requires about 40 kilobytes of ROM and tens of kilobytes of RAM.
lwIP is larger than uIP, but provides better throughput.
